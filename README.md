We take minimalist approaches to ML & AI. Cost efficient applications for low-budget scenarios.

## Local AI Agents
This is a freeware tool to demonstrate how we can run AI agents on simple computers.

# Demo

    Utilize language models locally to perform common tasks.

    Here is an example of text classification app. The same components can be used to automate processes through any platforms like data lakes, dbs, etc ...

    

## Requirements

    You must have kaggle account with permission to access gemma in order to download the model
